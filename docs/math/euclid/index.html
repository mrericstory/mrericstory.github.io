</h1>
<p><strong>Euclid</strong>, sometimes called <strong>Euclid of Alexandria</strong> to distinguish him from Euclid of Megara, was a Greek mathematician, often referred to as the &ldquo;founder of geometry&rdquo; or the &ldquo;father of geometry&rdquo;. He was active in Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy I (323–283 BC). His Elements is one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics, serving as the main textbook for teaching mathematics (especially geometry) from the time of its publication until the late 19th or early 20th century. In the Elements, Euclid deduced the theorems of what is now called Euclidean geometry from a small set of axioms. Euclid also wrote works on perspective, conic sections, spherical geometry, number theory, and mathematical rigour.</p>
<p>The English name Euclid is the anglicized version of the Greek name Εὐκλείδης, which means &ldquo;renowned, glorious&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="elements">
  Elements
  <a class="anchor" href="#elements">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Although many of the results in Elements originated with earlier mathematicians, one of Euclid&rsquo;s accomplishments was to present them in a single, logically coherent framework, making it easy to use and easy to reference, including a system of rigorous mathematical proofs that remains the basis of mathematics 23 centuries later.</p>
<p>There is no mention of Euclid in the earliest remaining copies of the Elements. Most of the copies say they are &ldquo;from the edition of Theon&rdquo; or the &ldquo;lectures of Theon&rdquo;, while the text considered to be primary, held by the Vatican, mentions no author. Proclus provides the only reference ascribing the Elements to Euclid.</p>
<p>Although best known for its geometric results, the Elements also includes number theory. It considers the connection between perfect numbers and Mersenne primes (known as the Euclid–Euler theorem), the infinitude of prime numbers, Euclid&rsquo;s lemma on factorization (which leads to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic on uniqueness of prime factorizations), and the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.</p>
<p>The geometrical system described in the Elements was long known simply as geometry, and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, however, that system is often referred to as Euclidean geometry to distinguish it from other so-called non-Euclidean geometries discovered in the 19th century.</p>

<p>Nefas discordemque domino montes numen tum humili nexilibusque exit, Iove. Quae
miror esse, scelerisque Melaneus viribus. Miseri laurus. Hoc est proposita me

<ul>
<li>Data deals with the nature and implications of &ldquo;given&rdquo; information in geometrical problems; the subject matter is closely related to the first four books of the Elements.</li>
<li>On Divisions of Figures, which survives only partially in Arabic translation, concerns the division of geometrical figures into two or more equal parts or into parts in given ratios. It is similar to a first-century AD work by Heron of Alexandria.</li>
<li>Catoptrics, which concerns the mathematical theory of mirrors, particularly the images formed in plane and spherical concave mirrors. The attribution is held to be anachronistic however by J J O&rsquo;Connor and E F Robertson who name Theon of Alexandria as a more likely author.</li>

<h2 id="lost-works">
  Lost works
  <a class="anchor" href="#lost-works">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Other works are credibly attributed to Euclid, but have been lost.</p>
<ul>
<li>Conics was a work on conic sections that was later extended by Apollonius of Perga into his famous work on the subject. It is likely that the first four books of Apollonius&rsquo;s work come directly from Euclid. According to Pappus, &ldquo;Apollonius, having completed Euclid&rsquo;s four books of conics and added four others, handed down eight volumes of conics.&rdquo; The Conics of Apollonius quickly supplanted the former work, and by the time of Pappus, Euclid&rsquo;s work was already lost.</li>
<li>Porisms might have been an outgrowth of Euclid&rsquo;s work with conic sections, but the exact meaning of the title is controversial.</li>
